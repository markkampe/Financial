# List of general ledger accounts
#
# This file defines the mapping from <Category,Item> entries in the Budget
#      spreadsheet to account names in the Leger file.
#      Each line is of the form:
Account, Category, Item
#	Account:	account name to appear in ledger
#	Category:	gross accounting area in budget file
#	Item:		(optional) sub-area within that category
#
#      This is mapping is useful because:
#	- the budget is more fine-grained (sub-categories) than the leger
#	- different Items witin a Category can map to different Accounts
#       - it also enables us to define the order of Accounts in the ledger
